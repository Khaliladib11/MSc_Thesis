# MSc in Artificial Intelligence Thesis

![teaser](./doc/images/BDD100K.png)
 
 This repository contains the code for my Master thesis. I will cover different tasks in computer vision field, like object detection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation and panoptic segmentation. I will be using different SOTA models.
 
 The main goal of this work is to compare the single task vs multi task learning models, as well as compare multi task models to YOLOP model. YOLOP model is a model that performs Object Detection and Semantic segmentation at the time.
 
 ## Dataset
 Dataset used is BDD100K which is available [here](https://www.bdd100k.com/).
